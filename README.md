History
-------

PHP is a powerful and versatile language but doesn't seem to be used at all for data mining, analysing and machine learning. One of the reasons could be there just are better tools for the job. However I do feel PHP can be very suitable in some specific use cases. Especially preprocessing data is a task which should be as easy todo with PHP as it is with other languages. Because I want to motivate and inspire other PHP developers to explore machine learning I started this project. Hopefully people will find use in this package and use it for their machine learning projects.

Contributing

This package is an open source project. Contribution is highly appreciated.
